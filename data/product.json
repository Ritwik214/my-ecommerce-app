When JCP had them again this spring, I ordered the additional colors, and an extra of both the tan and black, all in Misses Medium. They run a little large, but also shrink a little, so the first pairs were of a passable length after a couple of washes. The new black ones seemed a bit longer, but figured they were probably the original length of the ones from last year. All the other new ones were a good three to four inches longer than the black ones. On 5'5\" me they weren't going to work. Getting them taken up would have doubled the priced, so took a chance on a petite medium. They are perfect. Will have keep out of the dryer, but length is great and a little less baggy overall. Could only get dark tan and petite is out online, so maybe next year.","Had these pants in white, and was happy to find them in blue. They fit well and are like wearing your pajamas!","I'm really happy with these pants. I'm between an 8 and a 10 and got the small. At first they were a tiny bit snug, but stretched out to a very comfortable fit. They were long but I went ahead and washed them in warm water and dried them in the dryer. They shrunk to a good amount in length - I'm 5'6\" and they're a good length now for me. I agree with another reviewer that they don't really need tie and a button, but that's a small issue. Overall, great linen pants for the summer!","I tried three or four stores versions of this pant. Usually they were too short in the rise.Since they are bound to shrink, this doesn't do.When I tried these, they felt awesome and although I did buy a larger size because I like them loose and flowy and expect them to shrink, I am not worried about the rise shrinking up too much.I also like these because they do not hang too low on the hip; the waist hits me low waist or high hip, so they stay on good.","These pants are very comfortable. I usually have a problem with regular pants' length - they are usually too short. These are a nice length. The material is nice and airy for warmer weather.","Just plain perfect. fit, size, style, comfortable and cooool.","These pants were cute online, but a bit off in person. The green color was spot-on, and I loved it. The fabric is sturdy and light, just like linen should be. They were quite wide though, to the point that I'm going to a tailor to get them adjusted. I don't need them to be skinny, but having them be that flappy is foolish-looking and frumpy. Also, having an elastic waist with ties AND a button and zipper closure seems redundant. All in all, I'd recommend these pants to someone if they're getting them on sale like I did-you can then use the money you didn't spend initially on a tailor to make them into more attractive, better-fitting pants.","I ordered these pants online, which I usually do not do because different brands have different sizing. I was pleasantly surprised ‚Äî the pants fit well and the length was perfect. I was also a little hesitant to buy linen pants, but there's enough rayon in the fabric to keep the pants from wrinkling. To date, I've washed the pants several times and they wash well. I'm very pleased with my purchase."]}},
